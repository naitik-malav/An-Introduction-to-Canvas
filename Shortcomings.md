## Shortcomings :
* Though we had tried to make this language easy to understand, a requirement of the basic understanding of oop concepts with amplified image import and other game development features makes it a little harder for the basic user to link with it in comparision to languages like python but still easier to approach than C.
* As the program allows for more efficient and creative use of memory, to access its full capabilities a good understanding of memory is needed.
* Since this language is close to the processor and the programmer has been given access to many different attributes, even simple codes may be difficult to code. 
* As this language has low level abstraction, it is not very secure. If someone opens the code then he can easily manipulate the values and being closer to the hardware it can directly affect it.
* The language does not allow for global variables, the only global trait that can be declared are the attributes of ‘canvas’. 
* The language has a very strict syntax despite our best efforts to try and make it as readable as python.
* A compiler has yet not been designed, but we feel like the language can be slow if the programmer tries to load too many images.
